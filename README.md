# Functional Relational Programming In UI Frameworks

A talk I'm giving (or given if I haven't updated this) at LambdaConf 2016.

## Summary

Functional Relational Programming is a system architecture approach based on functional programming and the relational model. It was introduced in the seminal paper Out of the Tar Pit, but never gained much support in industry. Now, 10 years later, has this approach finally been adopted? New frameworks in the browser UI space like Redux.js, Om, re-frame, and Elm have been gaining traction with non-OO system architectures. We can see some of the core ideas of Functional Relational Programming in common use with these new frameworks. In this talk, we'll discuss the fundamental aspects of Functional Relational Programming and its purpose, and how those aspects are being used in modern UI frameworks.
